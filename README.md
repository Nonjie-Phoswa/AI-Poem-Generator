## 🛠️ Installation & Usage

To run this project locally:

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Nonjie-Phoswa/Daily-Affirmations-Generator.git
   cd daily-affirmations-generator
   ```

2. **Open `index.html` in your browser**

   - You can use the app, but only the default (non-AI) affirmations will be shown.

3. **To enable AI responses:**

   - Make sure you have [Netlify CLI](https://docs.netlify.com/cli/get-started/) installed.
   - Start the Netlify dev server in your project directory:

     ```bash
     netlify dev
     ```

   - This will run the Netlify functions locally and allow the app to fetch AI-generated responses.

   - Now, open `http://localhost:8888` in your browser to use the app with full AI functionality.

4. **(Optional) See the Netlify Functions**
   - The app uses a Netlify serverless function (`getAffirmation`) for AI responses.
   - See the `netlify/functions` directory for backend code.

## 💡 How It Works

- Enter a topic (e.g., "courage", "gratitude", "success") in the input field.
- Click "Generate" to receive a custom affirmation or poem.
- The app fetches a response from the AI backend and displays it with a typewriter animation.
